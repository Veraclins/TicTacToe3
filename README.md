# TicTacToe3
My Take A Climb Repository
This is my repository for Andela ALC with Google Take a Climb Challenge.

It is a simple Tic Tac Toe game having two modes (Single Player and Two Player) and which can be played on either a 3 X 3 or 5 X 5 board

The Single player is only available on the 3 X 3 board.

Please install the apps and try it out and let me know what you think.

Want to contribute to it, Just make a PR!

Remember, this is my first Android app so your feedback is highly appreciated!

Cheers!!!
